These two projects were part of the course Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems.
Many files were originally created by Dr. C. Jules White and can be found here: https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-14

The goal of Asgn1-VideoUp was to create a web application that allows clients to upload videos to a server. The server allows clients to first upload a video's metadata (e.g., duration, etc.) and then to upload the actual binary data for the video. The server should support uploading video binary data with a multipart request.

The goal of Asgn2-VideoLike was to allow users to authenticate using the OAuth 2.0 Password Grant flow. Once authenticated, users must be able to like/unlike videos, as well as search for videos by name and duration. In addition, video data must be stored in a Spring Data JPA repository.
